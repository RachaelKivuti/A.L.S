# ONLINE ALUMNI MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

<p>The Online Alumni Management System is a PHP MySQL project that helps a specific university school manages its alumni data. This project has two sides of users UI (user interface): the admin side/school management and the alumnus/alumna’s side. The admin side can manage all the job posted, alumni list, events, forum topics, and the gallery. The alumni site can create an account (to be verified by admin), post a job opportunity, create a forum topic, and join other forums, commit to participate in an upcoming event such as cultural week.</p>

<p>Talking about the Online Alumni Management System flow, the university school alumni will register to the website. This process will need the verification of the school management to enlist the alumnus/alumna in the website user. After the admin verifies the user as an alumnus of the school, the alumni user can begin to explore the features or functionalities of the system on their side, which are the job opportunities posted by other alumni or admin, a list of upcoming events, joining to the forum with the other alumni. For the administrator side of the system, aside from verifying the account and list of alumni, the admin will also manage the gallery to be displayed on the website. The gallery may contain some images of the school events with a short description. The admin will create the about content of the school to be also displayed on the website. This feature helps the school management update the about content of the system easily even without the presence of a developer. The admin can also post a job opportunity and can overwrite or manage the posted job and forum topic of an alumnus/alumni if any instances may occur.</p>
